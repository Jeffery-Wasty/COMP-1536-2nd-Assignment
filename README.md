This project required students to create a website using the Bootstrap library for all styling. The aim of the project was to create a website that was not only fully functional, but looked sleek, impressive, and most importantly, was able to be viewed on a moble device easily. The website itself was for a fictional cafe and included information such as the menu and performances happening at the cafe, as well as a job application page that sent submitted information to a PHP page (now defunct).
